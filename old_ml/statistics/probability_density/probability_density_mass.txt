Probability density function:
-> ex: normal distribution

A probabiliity density function:
For a given range of values, it gives you the probability of that range occurring
-> Probability of data point fallin within given range of given values
-> Curve that describes range of values happening with continuous data

A probability mass function:
-> Describes data as discrete values
